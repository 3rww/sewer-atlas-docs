# Sewer Atlas Data Downloads and Services

*Note: The Sewer Atlas' composite regional wastewater infrastructure dataset is not publicly available. If you would like to request access to this data, please contact [Annie Quinn @ 3 Rivers Wet Weather](mailto:aquinn@3rww.org).*

## Downloads

For registered 3RWW MDS users, all Sewer Atlas data is available for download in multiple GIS formats on the [MDS Downloads page](http://mds.3riverswetweather.org/downloads.aspx). This includes:

* Geopackage
* Open FileGDB-spec file geodatabase (includes a geometric network class that supports tracing in Esri ArcGIS Desktop)
* Esri Shapefile

Additionaly, two map packages (`.mpk`) files for ArcGIS Desktop are available:

* data embedded (as file geodatabase) and symbolized
* data linked to the live ArcGIS Server endpoints (same as used by the Sewer Atlas)

(Need another format? Let us know at [3rww@civicmapper.com](mailto:3rww@civicmapper.com))

## Web Services

### via ArcGIS Online

Esri ArcGIS Online Users can request access to 3RWW's Municipal Data Support Group, where downloads and links to live Sewer Atlas map and feature service layers (the same used by the Sewer Atlas web mapping application) are available.

If you are a 3RWW MDS user would like access to this ArcGIS Online group, please contact [Annie Quinn @ 3 Rivers Wet Weather](mailto:aquinn@3rww.org) with your ArcGIS Online username.

### via MDS

Web geodata services endpoints&mdash;links to the live data through OGC-compliant service endpoints&mdash;are currently not available via 3RWW's MDS Single Sign-On system. We plan to make them available in the future with that user login system.
